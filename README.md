# Pentesting-Tools
A collection of self-authored tools and scripts to make a pentester's life easier.

**fiercer** 
A simple version of the popular DNS bruteforcing tool, fierce. Removed mandatory zone transfers for more passivity and is less likely to crash on encountering malformed DNS records.

**img401**
A very simple slapped together script designed for proof-of-concept demonstration for certain XSS or HTML injection vulnerabilities. It hosts a fake webserver that responds to any request with a 401 Unauthorized HTTP response.

**unquotable**
A simple Python script for detecting unquoted Windows service paths vulnerable to privilege escalation.
