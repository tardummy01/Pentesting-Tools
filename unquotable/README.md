# unquotable
A simple Python script for detecting unquoted Windows service paths vulnerable to privilege escalation.

This script is designed to detect services running on your system whose executable paths:

	1) are unquoted
	2) contain spaces
	
For example:

	C:\Program Files\My Service\service.exe
	
Because the path is unquoted and because of the way windows tries to handle unquoted paths, it will search for the executable in the following paths (in order):
	
	C:\Program.exe
	C:\Program Files\My.exe
	C:\Program Files\My Service\service.exe
	
If an attacker has control over any of those directories, they can place a crafted executable there to hijack the permissions of the service in question. This tool identifies any unquoted service paths that could be exploited in this way.
